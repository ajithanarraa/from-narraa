### VOLLEY BALL

I like volleyball because itâ€™s **fast-paced** and **team-oriented**. It helps me stay fit, improve coordination, and build strong bonds with teammates. The thrill of a well-executed play is very satisfying.

### Code Fencing

This basic Node.js code is used to grab specified `command-line arguments`, we use the process module which gives control over the current Node.js process, and we remove the first two arguments from the command-line, the Node.js executable and the executed file name.

```
const getCmdArguments = () => process.argv.slice(2); 
```
